            <h2>Setting up a blog with ChatGPT</h2>
            <h5>How easy was it to set up this blog with ChatGPT?, Dec 14, 2023</h5>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My HTML knowledge is there, but it is nowhere near what I would like it to be.
                    As such, I decided to use a template for this blog. I found a template on W3Schools that was workable and decided to build off it.
                    It was extremely barebones, but it was a good starting point and, with the aid of ChatGPT, I was able to get it to where it is now.
                    The power of ChatGPT meant that I was able to give it my code and ask for a few modifications, such as the "Read More" button,
                    and it did it with no errors and gave exactly what I wanted. Granted, I have asked it things in the past and it did not perform
                    as well, but if you ask it the right questions, it can be a very powerful tool. And when it still doesn't work, I just have to figure
                    it out myself. Which, is just fine. But! I am using what it generates to learn, by reading through what it gives me and making sure I 
                    understand what it is doing. If I were to just rely on it entirely, I wouldn't be learning anything and defeating the purpose of this blog.
